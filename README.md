# Responsive Photo Gallery and Lightbox using CSS Grid and vanilla JavaScript

The goal here is to present a Lightbox consisting of an image, a URL link to another site and a description for that image. The Lightbox is open after clicking an image from a Photo Gallery.

I've used vanilla JavaScript and CSS Grid which will run in major browsers. An example was published at Codepen:
